Hi NetIDE team,

As discussed, I have contacted the Release Manager for ODL to let him know that the NetIDE project is finished. As such, we won't be contributing to the new Nitrogen release of OpenDaylight.

Rgds,
Alec.

Thank you for letting us know, please take a moment to send a public email to netide-dev mailing list stating your decision to drop from the Simultaneous Release.

Best Regards,
An Ho

An,

NetIDE will not be participating in the ODL Simultaneous Release Plan for Nitrogen. The project is being wound down internally.
The team is still available to support the existing releases (Carbon, Boron, etc).

If there is a process I should follow to formally exit, let me know.

Rgds,
Alec.
