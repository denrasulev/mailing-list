Subject: [stockholmodlug] Welcome to the Stockholm ODLUG mailing list
Message-ID: <D3624184.89550%christopher.price@ericsson.com>

Hi folks,

This distribution list is our Stockholm ODLUG mailing list.  I have had the e-mail addresses provided last week added to this list for us to use for communication.  The address for sending a message is: stockholmodlug at lists.opendaylight.org
To add e-mail addresses to this list simply enter them at: https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/stockholmodlug

Also to add a little cross-group plug, there will be a Stockholm SDN group meet up at the end of the month:  http://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-SDN-Group/events/231053993/

Regards,
Chris
