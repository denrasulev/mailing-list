Subject: [natapp-dev] natapp release/boron-sr3 doesn't work
Message-ID: <4B6E0EFA-F34B-4740-B357-1F290C931B0B@gmail.com>

Hi there,

i checkout release/boron-sr3 version, and run karaf after build.

using mininet for testing, and installed a flow as ?sh ovs-ofctl add-flow s1 dl_type=0x0806,actions=FLOOD"

gave json input of natType as {"natapp:input": { "type:pat":"?}}

gave json input of patNat as {"natapp:patNat": {"globalIP":"172.0.0.1/32?}}

In mininet prompt, open xterm for h1 h5
	$ xterm h1 h5

In xterm h5, give the following commands 
	$ ip r add 172.0.0.1/32 dev h5-eth0
	$ arp -s 172.0.0.1 00:00:00:00:00:01 
	$ nc -l 5000

In xterm h1, Give the following command 
	$ echo "TCS" | nc -p 8000 10.0.0.5 5000

Check for the PAT flows
	$ sh ovs-ofctl dump-flows s1

However It didn?t work. There was only one flow installed.

 so I tailed karaf log. It looks like never receive the notification for invoking the PacketProcessingListener.

Any ideas?
