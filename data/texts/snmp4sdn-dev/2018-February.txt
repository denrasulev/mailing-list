Subject: [snmp4sdn-dev] [Oxygen Projects] Important Reminder on RC0
Message-ID: <CAKxjJnTa8V4QgKVjU_h6s0gNccFKnhWjxFcO8b4aJWcQa3j62g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Oxygen Projects,

RC0 is in about 2 weeks on February 14.  If your project is not migrated to
work with the latest Odlparent/Yangtools and not in the distribution before
the date,  we will drop your project from the release.

Please see my email from yesterday for more details [1].

If you are in the red category (*eman, faaas, groupbasedpolicy, nic,
snmp4sdn, vtn*), it is imperative that you take action immediately.  Thanks!

Best Regards,
Kit Lou
