Subject: [net-virt-platform-dev] OFDPA TTP with ODL controller
Message-ID: <CAHWErLf86wWojL_RSWAJ7M7wb7qdq+_hGzqezNJ9pECCzKJP6g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi experts,

  I am trying to integrate OFDPA2.0 switch (with Indigo agent) with
OpenDayLight controller.

(1) Could someone explain me / point out how a switch and controller would
exchange TTP ? Just want to understand Switch and Controller negotiation on
TTP.

(2) I know, I need to write a new TTP for a specific application. But, how
to load the written TTP into the switch ? How switch would exchange it to
controller ?

Thanks,
__Kals__

Hi Kals,

A lot of folks and mailing lists on this CC - IMHO the ONL mailing list (
http://opennetlinux.org/community) is probably the best place for this.

For (1), I believe in theory there are protocols built into OFConfig (a
completely separate data channel) to get which TTP a switch supports and to
select which one to use.  Currently, OFDPA2.0 only supports a single TTP so
this is less important of a step.  Further, the Indigo OpenFlow agent
doesn't implement OFConfig (happy to accept the patch), so this information
isn't available through the switch agent anyway.  Best bet is to
dynamically pull from the website:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Broadcom-Switch/of-dpa/master/OF-DPA-2.0/ofdpa-v2.0.0.2.ttp.json


For (2), you don't/can't write a TTP for an application- it's the other way
around.  You write an application to a TTP.  Perhaps you're thinking of P4
where you write a P4 description of what you want the switch to do?  As I
mentioned above, while the underlying Broadcom hardware can in theory
support many many TTPs, OFDPA doesn't expose any of those knobs to you, so
there's only effectively the one TTP available.  In other words, you have
to think about how to use the existing tables exposed by OFDPA and figure
out how to manage them to support your application.

On the last part, I and my team have written a couple of applications on
top of OFDPA, so if you want to post to the ONL mailing lists, we'd be
happy to help you think this through.

Hope this helps,

- Rob
