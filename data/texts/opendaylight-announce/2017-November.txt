Message-ID: <9c8ef021-23aa-312a-6bb8-e605abf6549f@redhat.com>

OpenDayLights AAA module. The current status of the vulnerability is

opendaylight-advisory: Password change doesn't result in Karaf clearing
cache, allowing old password to still be used)

cve: CVE-2017-1000406

Vaibhav Hemant Dixit from Arizona State University reported a
vulnerability in OpenDayLight AAA, whereby should a user update a
password, the login is still successful with both OLD and NEW passwords.

This is a result of how claimCache is flushed in AAA IDM when using the
Karaf CLI.

The issue is not present when using the AAA IDM REST API, as the
handlers already invoke the clearing of the IdmLightProxy claimCache
upon user update.

A flush can be made by performing a reboot of Karaf or by applying the
patches referenced in this advisory, as the patches enable the Karaf CLI
to call IdmLightProxy claimCache and perform a flush every time a user
changes a password.

branch: master, nitrogen, carbon
review: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/topic:AAA-151
jira: https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/AAA-151

release-notes:
The fixes will be be available in the coming Nitrogen-SR1 and Carbon-SR3
releases.
