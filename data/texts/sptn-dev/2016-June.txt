Hi Weiqiang Cheng and SPTN Team,



Congratulations on your project being accepted as an incubation project [0].  As release manager of OpenDaylight, I would like to welcome you and your team to the OpenDaylight community.  If there is anything I can do to help you and your team, please do not hesitate to ask.  At this time, please consider the following:



* Finalize your list of committers.

* Create a project main wiki page [1].

* Open a ticket with helpdesk to create necessary project infrastructure [2].

* Decide if your project intends to participate in the Boron Simultaneous Release [3].

* Send M1/M2/M3 Status Email to join the Boron Simultaneous Release [4].

* Complete IPR Review for any incoming code [5].

* Accept/Decline Onboarding Interview [6].



At this time, please decide if your project would like to join in Boron (the current release) or Carbon (the next release). If you team would like to join Boron, your project will need to follow the complete the necessary work according to the Boron Simultaneous Release Plan Schedule [7] and complete the milestone requirements at the appropriate due date [4].



We conduct an optional Onboarding Interview to introduce new projects to the OpenDaylight Release and Development Process.  The optional Onboarding Interview provides your team with an opportunity to ask questions and connect with community resources in OpenDaylight. Please let us know if you are interested and what times works best for your schedule [5] in Pacific Time Zone (San Francisco).



We are delighted to have you join the OpenDaylight community and look forward to working with your team.



Best Regards,

An Ho
