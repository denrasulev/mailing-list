Dear Discovery, Plugin2OC and Amoury devs,

It appears as though your projects have been inactive for 18 months or
longer and thus the TSC is likely to archive the projects. I plan to
generate archive review documents today and start a TSC vote on them in two
weeks at the July 13th TSC call. The process is described here:

Hello TSC,

There's a few projects I've identified below as being inactive. Curious if
we should consider archiving some of these?


*armoury*
No real activity since 2015-11-02

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/project:armoury


*discovery*
No activity since 2015-04-09

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/project:discovery


*plugin2oc*
No activity since 2015-02-02

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/project:plugin2oc


*tcpmd5*
Last release was Beryllium and no activity since.

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/project:tcpmd5


Regards,
Thanh

This e-mail serves to start the 2 week counter to archive Discovery per
this Archive review:

I don't know if this mail was seen:
https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/tsc/2017-June/007494.html
It's basically saying that as PTL of Armoury, although away from ODL since
couple of months, it is fine by me to archieve this project.
Also, the active list of committers is most certainly composed of folks not
contributing to ODL anymore, and/or that have changed affiliation, hence I
tend to believe there is no real purpose in conducting a vote within the
Armoury project to approve this. My 0.02.

Cheers,
Alexis

So, is there a thread on the project's list asking for comment before
today? If not, I think we need to wait two weeks because we don't have a
vote of committers to archive it.
