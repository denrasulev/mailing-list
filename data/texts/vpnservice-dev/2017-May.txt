Hi Carbon Projects,


Please report any blocker bugs in Carbon by updating the Carbon Tracking Spreadsheet [1] or replying to this email.  Note
that the stable/carbon branch has been locked and only blocker bugs are permitted to merge at this time.


We currently have 6 Carbon Blocker Bugs from the following projects: integration/distribution, autorelease, openflowplugin,
odlparent


We kindly ask projects to share the status of your bugs by marking the bug as fixed and resolved (STATUS=RESOLVED), or
retargeting the bug for Nitrogen (ODL SR TARGET MILESTONE=NITROGEN), or providing an ETA for when it can be fixed in Carbon.


Best Regards,

An Ho
