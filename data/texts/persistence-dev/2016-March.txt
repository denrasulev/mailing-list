Subject: [persistence-dev] Plans for Archiving Persistence Project
Message-ID: <EEEA408CE50B48498B9F866085AEF2912FAEE634@SJCEML701-CHM.china.huawei.com>

Hi Persistence Team,

1. Does your project have any plans to be archived?  If your project has no plans for any future active development, project committers can vote to move a project to the Archived State by a Termination Review according to the OpenDaylight Project Lifecycle and Releases document [1].
2. If you projects plans to remain active, does it intend to participate in the Boron Simultaneous Release as documented in the Boron Release Plan [2]?  If not, could someone please publicly decline to participate with a message like so: "The <PROJECT_NAME> project is formally declining to participate in the Boron SR".

The last project related activity on Gerrit is Aug 21, 2015.

Best Regards,
An Ho
