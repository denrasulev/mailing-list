Subject: [advisory-group] End User Advisory Group Meeting at ONS
Message-ID: <CAGZqrsp87R6buSAtFexUKo9q=xb3=yuy7xgUSReZEtFYi+pYUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello ODL EUAG Members:

We wanted to let you know that we are hosting an open meeting of User
Advisory Groups at ONS. It will be a F2F meeting only (no telephone bridge)
and we are extending the invitation to the ODL EUAG, OPNFV EUAG, LFN member
representatives, and other service provider companies.

Now that we have established LF Networking, we'd like to talk to the
operator community about how to evolve the OPNFV EUAG and ODL EUAG going
forward, how to engage with more of the projects within LFN, and to ensure
that we have a strong end user voice in the work of LFN.

This meeting will take place Wednesday, March 28, 2:30 - 3:50 PM in the
KTown Room (across from the business center on the 5th floor on the ONS
venue). If you're going to be present at ONS, we hope that you will attend
this session to give us your views. If you will not be present, but you
will have colleagues in attendance at ONS, please forward this invitation
on them. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks!
