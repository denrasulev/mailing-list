Subject: [didm-dev] didm csit failing for carbon sr3
Message-ID: <b0275928-d122-4c08-f981-30942408366d@gmail.com>

Hi DIDM,

I think your csit jobs are not watched or used. Please correct me
if I am wrong. the nitrogen version of the csit job hasn't run
since august and the carbon job has basic/consistent failures. If
it's of no value to you, we could remove it entirely to save some
cycles in jenkins.

We had requested you to update the carbon sr3 tracking sheet, but
as it's not been updated, I took the liberty to mark it as IGNORE.

Regards,
JamO
