Subject: [projectleads] OFDPA TTP with ODL controller
Message-ID: <CAHWErLf86wWojL_RSWAJ7M7wb7qdq+_hGzqezNJ9pECCzKJP6g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi experts,

  I am trying to integrate OFDPA2.0 switch (with Indigo agent) with
OpenDayLight controller.

(1) Could someone explain me / point out how a switch and controller would
exchange TTP ? Just want to understand Switch and Controller negotiation on
TTP.

(2) I know, I need to write a new TTP for a specific application. But, how
to load the written TTP into the switch ? How switch would exchange it to
controller ?

Thanks,
__Kals__
