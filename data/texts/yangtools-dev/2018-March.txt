Adding yangtools and Robert [as I don't have subscription to yangtools] as this looks like old yangtools issue.

Hi Yangtools devs,

During yangtools migration we ran into an issue in OVSDB and OFPlugin where two versions of network-topology were being loaded which broke OVSDB's InstanceIdentifierCodec.serialize() It couldn't figure out the correct Qname when there were two revisions of same model loaded.

At the time we added a work around [5] that hardcoded network-topology revision and I believe yangtools apparently fixed it. Issue with fix is that OVSDB augments network-topology and for those models revision is different. That is why I attempted a CSIT run on the patch [6] that reverts this change. But now we ran into original issue that we had put a workaround for as seen in [7], search for 'Failed to map QName {}'

Any suggestions on the same? Do we need to rewrite our serializers? If yes, inputs would be welcome. [8] is the original bug raised for this.

Regards,
Vishal.

Subject: RE: [ovsdb-dev] OVSDB CSIT Failures on Oxygen

Hi Jamo,

Looking at logs, noticed something else strange too in our test cases.[2] Is adding a node to 10.30.170.187:6634 with nodeId as ovsdb:HOST1. At this point we already have the same node present with nodeId 10.30.170.187:6634 in operational which was actually done in previous step [3]. So we now have two entries in operational for the same which can be seen in [4]. Is this a wrong use case or bug in code?

Sam/Anil,
Inputs? Do we support two connections to the same node in config? Just before the qos-entries failure I also see these log entries:

Still looking into the yangtools issue, but could be related to this 'two entries for same in operational'. Likely it is looking for key to exist before allowing operation and is picking up the wrong/old nodeId instead of new one where we're trying to configure it.

Regards,
Vishal.

Hi Jamo,

Looking at the log you pasted, I think it is related to yangtools changes that came in during Nov/Dec that added stricter checking. I'll try figure it out, maybe check with Robert on what this error means.

Vishal.

Vishal,

here's a jira:
  https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/OVSDB-453

it's marked blocker for Oxygen.

How can I help to get this figured out?

Thanks,

The original issue was a ordering one, now it would seem you cannot find
the module in the SchemaContext -- at this point the question is, what
modules are in the SchemaContext -- you'll need to debug that on your
side...

More specifically, it seems your class is not thread-safe w.r.t.
SchemaContext updates.

Stephen,
Any comments on thread safety of code calling serialize?

Note that these failures are on a patch that reverted the workaround that we did for yangtools issue. There are no other changes in OVSDB code, except the checkstyle etc. fixes.

Vishal.

Subject: [yangtools-dev] yangtools-2.0.2 release candidate available
Message-ID: <cc0826f2-faa0-0484-f62b-6c33b87bfe7c@hq.sk>

Hello everyone,

yangtools-2.0.2 release candidate is available at
https://nexus.opendaylight.org/content/repositories/yangtools-1006/.

This release brings a few bugfixes and some optimizations, most
significant changes are summarized here:
https://jira.opendaylight.org/projects/YANGTOOLS/versions/10539.

Full list of all changes is available here:
https://github.com/opendaylight/yangtools/compare/v2.0.1...master.

This release is targeted for integration into both Fluorine and Oxygen
SR1, prior to integrating of next odlparent release, so that we have
fewer moving bits in the integration.

Patches for Fluorine are tracked at:
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/topic:yangtools-2.0.2+branch:master.

Unless anything comes up, I will ask the candidate to be promoted over
the weekend.

The next batch of fixes (notably NETCONF-486, which is soaking in Carbon
and Nitrogen) will be delivered in the next released, when odlparent is
ready to integrate.

Regards,
Robert
