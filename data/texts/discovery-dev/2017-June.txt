Dear Discovery, Plugin2OC and Amoury devs,

It appears as though your projects have been inactive for 18 months or
longer and thus the TSC is likely to archive the projects. I plan to
generate archive review documents today and start a TSC vote on them in two
weeks at the July 13th TSC call. The process is described here:
