Subject: [controller-announce] Can I use Opendaylight to install flow table
 which includes the application layer header match?
Message-ID: <5304DDC9.8080706@gmail.com>

Hi guys:
           Now I am trying to implement something and need your help. I 
send packets including my application layer header to the Openswitch, 
the controller will pull this kind of packets and set some actions, such 
as modify the destination IP address, at the same time install the flow 
table to the switch and let the following packet can match the 
application headers and route to the modified destination IP address? 
Can I implement this by using Opendaylight or other controller.
          What I have done is that I can pull the packets to controller 
and strip off  the IP,TCP headers and get the application headers and 
according to the data of application headers  I modify the packets' 
destination IP address. But Now I want to install the flow table to let 
the following packets can following the rule, so I need to match the 
application header fields, not just the Source IP address, Destination 
IP address, Source Transport port and Destination transport port and so 
on. How can I do it ? Can anybody give me any advice?

Thanks very much for your help!
