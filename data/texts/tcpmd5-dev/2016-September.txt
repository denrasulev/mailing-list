Subject: [Tcpmd5-dev] Closing Weather Item: TCPMD5 migration to
 netty-native-trasport-epoll
Message-ID: <EEEA408CE50B48498B9F866085AEF2912FB3A51B@SJCEML701-CHM.china.huawei.com>

Hi TCPMD5,

We believe that the following weather item has been resolved and would like to close this item by moving it to the Historical Weather Page.  Please let us know if your teams have any objections or concerns and we will revert the action.  Please let us know if this weather item has not been resolved and has pending work.  Thank you for the tremendous help in this cross project effort.

Name: TCPMD5 migration to netty-native-trasport-epoll
Description: For projects dependent on TCP-MD5, all required functionality is available in netty-native-trasport-epoll v. 4.0.33 and later. Dependent projects should migrate to using netty-provided functionality.

Best Regards,
An Ho
