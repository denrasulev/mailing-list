Hi,

I tried to build VBD localy and it was successful. However the gui part was done by Daniel (on cc). Maybe he knows more about this error.

BTW: Why was this sent to honeycomb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org . This mailing list does not exist. It should be vbd-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:vbd-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>

Attention honeycomb-devs,

Autorelease carbon failed to build vbd-ui-module from honeycomb in build
506. Attached is a snippet of the error message related to the
failure that we were able to automatically parse as well as console logs.

Please review and provide an ETA on when a fix will be available.

Thanks,

Hello honeycomb-dev team:

Please confirm if this is an intermittent issue or something which needs to be fixed.

Thanks,

Hello,


problem was in downloading dependency from 3rd party repository:

[ERROR] bower angular#1.4.14                ECONNREFUSED Request to https://bower.herokuapp.com/packages/angular failed: connect ECONNREFUSED

It happens from time to time. Run the build again.
Real solution is to move from Bower to Npm, so instead of two failing repos there will be only one [?]



dano
