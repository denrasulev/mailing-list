Over the last 6 months, I had proposed 5 minor enhancements to your
project, see https://git.opendaylight.org/
gerrit/#/q/owner:vorburger+project:centinel:

* https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/50860/
* https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/49722/
* https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/49727/
* https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/50894/
* https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/50302/

As none of them have been merged in 6 months, I'm assuming your project is
dead, and have therefore Abandoned those patches. Should you nevertheless
have any interest in them, please feel free to Restore them in Gerrit, or
reply to this email if you would like me to restore and rebase (some of)
them.

Tx,
M.
