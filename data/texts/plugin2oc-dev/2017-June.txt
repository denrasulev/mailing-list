Dear Discovery, Plugin2OC and Amoury devs,

It appears as though your projects have been inactive for 18 months or
longer and thus the TSC is likely to archive the projects. I plan to
generate archive review documents today and start a TSC vote on them in two
weeks at the July 13th TSC call. The process is described here:

Hello TSC,

There's a few projects I've identified below as being inactive. Curious if
we should consider archiving some of these?


*armoury*
No real activity since 2015-11-02

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/project:armoury


*discovery*
No activity since 2015-04-09

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/project:discovery


*plugin2oc*
No activity since 2015-02-02

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/project:plugin2oc


*tcpmd5*
Last release was Beryllium and no activity since.

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/project:tcpmd5


Regards,
Thanh

As you can all see from the other thread on the TSC list, we've started the
archive process for the 2 remaining projects which aren't already archived.

Looks like we missed archiving it. It is now complete.
