Subject: [odlug] Request for ODL participation in Swiss SDN user group
Message-ID: <1489055981.26085.19.camel@ericsson.com>


Hello,

I received the below email from a colleague in Switzerland (in cc) who is participating in the ODL SFC project with me.

Is there anyone in Switzerland (either living or possibly traveling there soon) that would be available to present ODL at the Swiss SDN meetup?

Thanks,

Brady



Hi Brady, all,


unrelated to the topic, i forgot to mention on Friday if you are interested

or know someone from the ODL community to give a demo/talk to the Swiss SDN

meetup/workshop i am in charge for, please let me know. I know community

people are moving so it might well match to someone's schedule. The info is here:


https://www.meetup.com/SDN-Switzerland/events/237925842/


I don't want to spam on the group so please feel free to send it over where applicable.

We had ONOS presenter last time, but not yet ODL and it would be really great if so.


Thanks,

Irena
