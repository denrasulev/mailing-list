Subject: [Transportpce-dev] Transport PCE - Current status and user guide
Message-ID: <CAFJMJikT9TxjHL1U_bpra4=RkzkqeD9=Uc=ew_pWephBoa3K-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

I came across this application that serves as an external PCE, but not sure
if it has become a dormant project.
Can someone point me to any user guide / documentation that captures some
pointers on how can we run and use the application?

Thanks much
Priyanka

Hello

Transport PCE is not a dormant project even if there is very few messages on this mailing-list.
Most contributors exchanges are done directly between them.

We do not participate the release process yet, so there is no official documentation.
You can refer to the wiki or the gerrit repository, preferably the nitrogen branch at this moment.
The master branch currently compiles but there is a runtime problem due to some dependencies with other projects.

Just to be clear, transport PCE is not a generic PCE but a controller for OpenROADM devices that operates at the transport layer.

Hope this helps

Best regards
Guillaume
