cc-ing docs, I think the outline is for new projects or new features to have some initial doc pushed in: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Oxygen_Release_Plan#Timeline_for_Deliverables_from_Projects <https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Oxygen_Release_Plan#Timeline_for_Deliverables_from_Projects>

Correct, M2 is outline.  By M3, some content.  At M4, the docs should be completed.

Hi Frank,

On your documentation section question, I have to defer to team members who have a longer history with ODL to respond.  It seems a bit redundant to me as the first part of the documentation section covers the information.  Perhaps Thanh and/or An can comment?

On your project facts question,  please look at your project wiki page: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/EMAN:Main

The Facts box on the right needs to be updated.  I can see the Type field is not updated: it should be "Application" for your project.  It seems important that you try to bring in more committers for the EMAN project.  Thank you!

Best Regards,
Kit Lou

I have submitted eman M2 readout to gerrit

I have some questions about the m2 template

Documentation section:
* what is ' reStructuredText outline? - is this a new requirement? Is there a template for the outline? if not, what is the outline supposed to contain?

Project specific section
* what are ?project facts?? - is this a new requirement? Is there a template, what are its contents, where does it live?

Hello Oxygen Projects,

For the projects (details below) that have submitted M2 project status  - thank you!

We are still waiting for Oxygen M2 Project Status from the 12 following projects: dlux, dluxapps, eman, faas, jsonrpc, mdsal, netconf, of-config, p4plugin, snmp4sdn, unimgr, yangtools

We request that these 12 projects submit their M2 status as soon as possible!

Instructions: Please make a copy of the m2 status template file [1], update, and submit your milestone readout into this folder of the docs project:  "docs/release-process/milestone-readouts/m2".

There is a useful online reStructuredText tool [2] you can use to validate your rst file contents - copy the rst file contents into the left pane and you will see the rendered HTML on the right pane.  If your rst file checkin fails verification, it will likely be failing the tox coala check.  Please look for the tox-coala.log.gz file in the build log for details.
