Hello,
I am working on an OpenVirtex Project and I am kinda stuck and would like to ask for help.?I just want to ask that if I consolidated three physical switches into one virtual switch. So do I need to add flows to all the trunk ports or I just need to write flows for only the host access ports that are attached to that virtual switch.
I am also trying to connect my opendaylight boron controller but it is continuosly showing error of reconnectHandler and failing to connect the controller. It would be helpful if i can get some guidance.
Regards,Maheen Iqbal
