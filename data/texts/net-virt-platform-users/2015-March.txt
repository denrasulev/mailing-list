Subject: [net-virt-platform-users] OSCP & net-virt vs. Helium & VTN
Message-ID: <c9lt7btxjila14if3qwb9ryn.1426146292324@email.android.com>

Hello everybody

Can someone enlighten me about the differences between OSCP with net-virt and Helium Release with VTN.?
I am especially interested in the virtual router and the ACL feature.

OSCP & net-virt seems to have both features implemented and documented, according to the example (not tried yet).
I might be wrong, but I couldn't find any up-to-date information - is OSCP & net-virt still alive and maintained?

In ODL Helium & VTN, at least the vRouter feature seems to be not yet implemented (REST API not supported in current release).?
(When) does VTN support the same features as net-virt?

Kind regards & many thanks
Lukas
